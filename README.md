### In this app we created 4 fragments. On the first fragment we have an image button and a progress bar that increases eith each click on the image. The image has an alertbox indicating how many times it has been clicked. After 5 clicks the progressbar dissapears and on the 8th click the app closes.
###The second fragment contains 3 options in whcih an alartbox with toast saying what option you selected pops up.
###In the third fragment it contains a listview of stringsarray provinces&territories in which it will highlight what item is selected, thie index it is in, and passes that information to the fourth fragment.
###In the fourth fragment it displays the time (current and updating) and the province you selected with the index number it was.
